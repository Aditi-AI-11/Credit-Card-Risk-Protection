        "Section 1: The importance of this project lies in the fact that predicting good clients is crucial for banks to minimize risks and maximize profits. Accurate credit card approval prediction can help banks identify high-risk applicants and make informed decisions. This project can have a significant impact on the banking sector by reducing the number of bad loans and improving the overall creditworthiness of customers.\n",
