# Credit-Card-Risk-Protection
This project builds a predictive model to evaluate credit card application approvals using machine learning techniques. By analyzing application data through exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning (mean/median imputation, Winsorization), and logistic regression, the model identifies key factors influencing approval decisions.

Importance of the Project

Predicting good credit card clients is crucial for banks to minimize financial risk and maximize profits. Accurate prediction of credit card approval helps banks identify high-risk applicants and make informed lending decisions. This project aims to improve the credit card approval process for banks in India by using machine learning models to predict applicant creditworthiness.

There is currently a gap in the use of machine learning for credit card approval prediction in the Indian banking sector. This project fills that gap by developing a predictive model tailored to Indian banking data.

Hypothesis

Annual income and employment status are strong indicators of credit card approval.

Machine learning models can identify meaningful patterns in customer data related to creditworthiness.

The model can achieve at least 80% accuracy in predicting approvals.

Data Analysis Approach

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Merge datasets, handle missing values, convert datatypes, and address outliers.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identify relationships between variables like income and approval status.

Feature Engineering: Transform categorical features into numerical form for modeling.

Data Visualization: Use plots to understand data distribution and relationships.

Machine Learning Approach

Model Selection: Train several models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Neural Networks.

Model Evaluation: Use accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics to assess performance.

Model Comparison and Tuning: Select the best model and tune hyperparameters for optimal accuracy.

Summary of Results

Logistic Regression achieved approximately 90% accuracy on the test set.

The model showed strong precision for the majority class but struggled with minority class predictions due to class imbalance.

Handling imbalance and exploring additional models could further improve results.

How to Use This Project

Load and merge the provided datasets.

Preprocess the data following the cleaning and encoding steps.

Train the machine learning model on training data and evaluate on test data.

Interpret model metrics to understand performance and limitations.

Future Directions

Implement techniques like SMOTE or class weighting to address class imbalance.

Experiment with more complex models like Random Forests and Neural Networks.

Develop a deployment pipeline to integrate the model with banking systems for real-time decision-making.
