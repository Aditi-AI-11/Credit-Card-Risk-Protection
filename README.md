# Credit-Card-Risk-Protection
This project builds a predictive model to evaluate credit card application approvals using machine learning techniques. By analyzing application data through exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning (mean/median imputation, Winsorization), and logistic regression, the model identifies key factors influencing approval decisions.
